# Data Communication and Networking

## Basic Concept of Network Architecture

Network architecture is the design of a computer network. It is a framework for the specification of a network's physical components and their functional organization and configuration, its operational principles and procedures, as well as communication protocols used. It is the physical and logical design of a computer network. This framework is often represented with a diagram to provide the precise description of an established network, and the system is designed by the network architect with the help of network engineers.
